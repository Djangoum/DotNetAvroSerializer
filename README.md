# Dotnet Avro Serializer

Dotnet AvroSerializer is a source generator based avro serialization library for .NET. This Library is **Under construction**. This is not yet published and is also an experimentation exercice for the author (me :D) to learn about avro and source generators.

The library currently only supports serialization (not deserialization)

I'll add a list of missing features to complete a first usable (not production ready) version of the write part. 

- [x] Decimal Logical Type
- [x] Unions
- [x] Maps
- [x] Fixed
- [x] Enum
- [ ] Time (micro) Logical Type
- [ ] Timestamp (micro) Logical Type
- [ ] Local timestamp (micro) Logical Type
- [ ] Custom logical types (?)

Known issues : 

- [ ] Do not support for more than one usage of the same enum per schema

Everything is pending for deserialization :)
